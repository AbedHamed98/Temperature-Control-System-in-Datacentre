# Temperature-Control-System-in-Datacentre
This is the Embeded project 
It uses PIC16F877A microcontroller to design a simple 
control system to be used in a server room in some datacentre
 Basically, the room is 
equipped with two huge 220-Volt DC fans and it is required to control the temperature 
inside the room in a power- efficient approach through adjusting the speed of the fans 
according to the room temperature.
